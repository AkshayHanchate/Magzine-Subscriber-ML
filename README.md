Magazine Subscription Analysis
Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer subscriptions to a magazine service using machine learning techniques. Through feature engineering and model comparison, it identifies key predictors of subscription behavior, such as income, education, and previous campaign interactions. By understanding these drivers, the analysis supports targeted marketing strategies to improve conversion rates.

Dataset
The dataset includes a variety of features that reflect customer demographics, past interactions, and purchasing patterns. Key features include:

Income: Customer income level.
Education: Education level, which correlates with subscription tendencies.
Accepted Campaigns: Indicators of whether a customer previously accepted campaign offers (e.g., AcceptedCmp1, AcceptedCmp2, etc.).
Response: The target variable indicating whether a customer subscribes.
Model Comparison
After experimenting with several models, Logistic Regression and SVM with a Linear Kernel emerged as the top-performing models for predicting subscription behavior. Hereâ€™s a summary:

Accuracy: Logistic Regression achieved ~82.4%, and SVM Linear Kernel achieved ~82.7%.
Precision and Recall:
Both models achieved moderate precision (~0.42), effectively identifying subscribers while avoiding excessive false positives.
Recall (~0.6774) indicates that these models are well-suited to identifying true positives (subscribers) without missing too many potential subscribers.
Given the balanced performance of precision and recall, both models are recommended for their overall reliability in identifying subscribers.

Key Variables Influencing Subscription
Analysis highlighted the following features as influential in predicting subscription behavior:

Accepted Campaigns: Customers who previously accepted campaign offers are more likely to subscribe again, making campaign acceptance history a valuable predictor.

Business Insight: Marketing teams should prioritize personalized or premium offers for customers who previously engaged with campaigns.
Income: Higher-income customers tend to subscribe more frequently, especially those purchasing premium products.

Business Insight: Segment higher-income customers for tailored marketing strategies, while designing budget-friendly campaigns for lower-income groups to enhance engagement.
Education: Graduated customers show higher likelihoods of subscription, correlating with income and purchasing behavior.

Business Insight: Campaigns could focus on educational content that appeals to customers with higher educational backgrounds.
Conclusion
Logistic Regression and SVM (Linear Kernel) are recommended for subscription prediction, achieving the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall. Key factors include past campaign acceptance, income, education, and marital status. Focusing on these predictors allows the business to identify and engage with high-potential customers effectively.
